# Commitron configuration file
# This file should be placed at ~/.commitronrc

# AI provider configuration
ai:
  # Available providers: openai, gemini, ollama, claude
  provider: ollama
  # Your API key for the selected provider
  api_key: your-api-key-here
  # The model to use - varies by provider
  model: mistral:latest
  # Control creativity (0.0-1.0): lower values are more deterministic, higher values more creative
  temperature: 0.7
  # Set to true to see detailed debugging information about AI requests and responses
  debug: false
  # Maximum tokens in AI response (increase for longer commit messages or more complex changes)
  max_tokens: 1000
  # Optional custom system prompt - overrides default AI instructions
  # Leave empty to use the default prompt that matches the selected convention
  # For conventional commits, a default prompt like this will be used:
  # system_prompt: |
  #   Generate a concise git commit message written in present tense for the following code changes.
  #   Commit message must be a maximum of 72 characters.
  #   Include a brief descriptive body explaining the changes.
  #   Choose an appropriate type from: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert.
  #system_prompt: ""
  # Only needed for Ollama, defaults to http://localhost:11434
  ollama_host: http://localhost:11434
  # Optional custom OpenAI API endpoint (e.g., for OpenAI-compatible services)
  # Defaults to https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions if not specified
  #openai_endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

# Commit message configuration
commit:
  # Available conventions: none, conventional, custom
  convention: conventional
  # Whether to include a message body after the subject
  include_body: true
  # Maximum length for the subject line
  max_length: 72
  # Maximum length for the commit body - keep this concise to avoid truncation
  max_body_length: 400
  # Only used when convention is 'custom'
  # custom_template: "{{type}}({{scope}}): {{subject}}"

# Context settings for AI
context:
  # Whether to include file names in the context
  # Provides basic information about which files changed
  include_file_names: true

  # Whether to include the git diff in the context
  # This is the most important setting for accurate commit messages
  # STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to keep this enabled
  include_diff: true

  # DEPRECATED: Use max_input_tokens instead
  # Maximum character length for the context (kept for backward compatibility)
  # max_context_length: 4000

  # NEW: Maximum tokens for input context (recommended over max_context_length)
  # This is the actual token limit sent to the AI provider
  # OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-4o): 100,000 is safe under 128K limit
  # Claude models: up to 180,000 tokens
  # Gemini 1.5+: up to 900,000 tokens
  # Ollama: depends on model, typically 8,000
  max_input_tokens: 100000

  # NEW: Strategy for handling large diffs that exceed token limits
  # Options:
  #   - "auto": Automatically choose based on size (recommended)
  #   - "summarize": Intelligently summarize diff preserving key changes
  #   - "batch": Process very large diffs in batches (for 200K+ tokens)
  #   - "truncate": Simple truncation at token boundary
  diff_strategy: auto

  # NEW: Model to use for token counting (leave empty to use ai.model)
  # Only set this if you want different tokenization than your AI model
  # tokenizer_model: ""

  # NEW: Enable smart diff summarization
  # When true, uses priority-based summarization for large diffs
  # High-priority files (core logic) get full context
  # Low-priority files (tests, docs) get summaries
  summarization_enabled: true

  # Include statistics about file changes (+/- lines)
  # Helps AI understand the magnitude and type of changes
  include_file_stats: true

  # Include brief description of what each file does (based on first few lines)
  # Helps AI understand the purpose of each file
  include_file_summaries: true

  # Show the first N lines of each file for additional context
  # Set to 0 to disable
  # Note: This is skipped when include_diff is true to avoid duplication
  show_first_lines_of_file: 5

  # Include high-level repository structure for better context
  # Helps for changes that affect multiple parts of the codebase
  # May not be needed for simple changes
  include_repo_structure: false

# User interface configuration
ui:
  # Enable TUI (Text User Interface) for better visualization
  # Shows staged files and commit message with confirmation
  enable_tui: true

  # Ask for confirmation before finalizing the commit message
  confirm_commit: true

  # Maximum number of files to display in the TUI (0 = no limit)
  # Useful for commits with many files
